# EA Movie Recommendation

## Overview

This project is part of the EA Movie Recommendation competition. The goal is to develop a recommendation algorithm that accurately predicts how users will rate movies they havenâ€™t seen yet. Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping individuals make informed choices about the content they engage with daily, both socially and economically.

## Objectives

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Use metadata and user preferences to recommend movies.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage user interaction data to recommend movies based on similar user profiles.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the model to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring fast performance even with millions of records.

## Features

- **Hybrid Model**: Combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering approaches.
- **Large-Scale Data**: Handles datasets with over 10 million records efficiently.
- **Optimized Libraries**: Utilizes libraries like `scikit-learn` and `dask` to ensure high performance and scalability.
- **Movie Metadata**: Uses detailed movie information, such as genre and IMDb links, to enhance recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following components:

- **Movie Metadata**: Information about the movies, such as titles, genres, and descriptions.
- **User Ratings**: Data on how users have rated various movies.
- **Movie Tags**: Tags describing the movies, helping in content-based filtering.
- **IMDb Links**: Links to IMDb for additional movie-related information.

## Installation

To set up the environment, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn dask

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data and train the recommendation model:

jupyter notebook movie_recommendation.ipynb
